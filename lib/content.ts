  description: `The More Excellent Way is a lifestyle. It is about producing people who understand the mechanics of learning. In life, a person is constantly learning—learning to be a better parent, learning to be a better engineer, learning to do their jobs better.

  University is just the first place people will face certain kinds of challenges. Doubts about their intelligence, a requirement to succeed at a task they might not care about personally, before they get to the workplace and are forced to deliver on topics they might have never dealt with.

  Do university right and you're launched into the world with a certain amount of character and skills that will serve you throughout life.`,

  content: `To give students the toolkit they need to produce consistently good results and handle academic crisis. The More Excellent Way produces excellent students. We define an excellent student as one who understands how they learn, is willing and able to combat any external obstacles to achieve their goals, and has the right mindset towards learning.

  The impact of TMEW goes beyond good grades in university. We are always learning how to produce excellent results and overcome challenges. A person with the skill of learning will find greater success in all areas of their life.

  We are creating a generation of youth who take charge of their own learning—problem solvers when they face difficulties, future entrepreneurs and business leaders who can be more innovative and broaden their expertise to fit into any role because they have the skills required to facilitate their own learning. We present to you the next set of leaders that make relevant impact because they work their way through challenges.`,

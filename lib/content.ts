  subtitle: "A Lifestyle, Not just an Academic Intervention",
  description: `The More Excellent Way (TMEW) is a student-focused learning and development organisation committed to raising disciplined, intentional, and high-performing students across learning institutions.
TMEW is founded on a simple but powerful conviction: learning itself is a skill — one that can be trained, practised, and mastered. When students are equipped early with the right learning systems and habits, they are positioned to excel consistently throughout their academic journey and beyond.
We design practical, student-centric interventions that move students from academic survival to sustainable excellence. Our work is grounded in the understanding that foundations matter. This is why TMEW focuses strongly on students at critical transition points — particularly secondary school students and undergraduate freshmen — where learning habits, academic identity, and self-discipline are still being formed.
`,
  mission: "The More Excellent Way exists to help students build effective learning systems, discipline, and structure that enable consistent academic excellence and the ability to fully maximise opportunities throughout their university journey and beyond",
  vision: "To raise a generation of intentional, disciplined, and excellent learners who are academically grounded, purpose‑driven, and equipped to thrive as future professionals and leaders.",

We define an excellent student as one who understands how they learn, is willing and able to combat any external obstacles to achieve their goals, and has the right mindset towards learning.

  The impact of TMEW goes beyond good grades in university. We are always learning how to produce excellent results and overcome challenges. A person with the skill of learning will find greater success in all areas of their life.

  We are creating a generation of youth who take charge of their own learning—problem solvers when they face difficulties, future entrepreneurs and business leaders who can be more innovative and broaden their expertise to fit into any role because they have the skills required to facilitate their own learning. We present to you the next set of leaders that make relevant impact because they work their way through challenges.`,
